Introduction {.unnumbered}
==========================

Project Deadlock is a system that controls access to a number of points of access (eg. doors, appliances) using RFID cards.

Unlike existing commercial solutions, Deadlock is fully open-source and open-hardware, and designed  to be flexible, maintainable, and cost-effective. We provide tools and expose all interfaces and components, making Deadlock easy to integrate with existing systems and customize to the needs of the user.

Deadlock is designed for security and reliability, assuming untrusted and unreliable network.

Deadlock is a joint project by the faculty's Student Development Team[^svt] -- implemented by students and managed by professors at the faculty.

This thesis first introduces the requirements/specification (chapter \ref{spec}) and the high-level design choices we made to fulfill it (chapter \ref{overview}). We then focus on the server/controller communication protocol (chapter \ref{protocol}) and the server design and implementation (chapter \ref{server}). Then we look at the future plans (chapter \ref{future}).

\TODO{mention which is my work and which is overview; talk to someone about Adam's thesis.}
